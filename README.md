# ZenCord 
Originally developed by [Nevvulo](https://github.com/Nevvulo) by the name of `Peace of Mind`, this is a Powercord plugin that introduces Zen mode for Discord, similar to Visual Studio Code's Zen mode.

Zen mode should work with any themes and plugins, as all it does is target actual Discord CSS. For example, I use a minimal discord theme and a messagebox-changing them with a lot of random plugins.
