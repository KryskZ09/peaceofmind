# Peace of Mind
Originally developed by [Nevvulo](https://github.com/Nevvulo), this is a
Powercord plugin that introduces Zen mode for Discord, similar to Visual Studio Code's Zen mode.

## How do I use this thing?
**You can use `CTRL + ALT + [` (left square bracket) to enable full zen mode, which looks like this:** ![](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/2DwaA64F.png) You can toggle it on/off using the same key combination.

You can also alternatively try a "half-zen" mode using `CTRL + ALT + ]` (right square bracket), which just removes content from the existing columns that Discord has. It looks like this: ![](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/BEqLtX80.png)
